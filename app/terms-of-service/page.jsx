        <h4 id="our-services">1. OUR SERVICES</h4>
        <p>
          The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
          distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
          country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
          regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement
          within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
          choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own
          initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws,
          if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The Services are not
          tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health
          Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal
          Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your
          interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the
          Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate the
          Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

        <h4 id="dispute">20. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h4>
        <br />
        <h5>Informal Negotiations</h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,
          controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute"
          and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us
          (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties
          agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes
          expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days
          before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence
          upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>Binding Arbitration</h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
          negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded
          below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding
          arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD
          HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration
          shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration
          Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where
          appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
          Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the
          American Arbitration Association (AAA) website. Your arbitration fees
          and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA
          Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer
          Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive,
          we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be
          conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or
          online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not
          provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The
          arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged
          if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by
          the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take
          place in United States, California. Except as otherwise provided
          herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
          proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, ol
          enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
          arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state
          and federal courts located in United States, California, and the
          Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal
          jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and
          jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the
          United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
          Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are
          excluded from these Legal Terms. If this provision is found to be
          illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate
          any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
          illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court
          of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
          above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
          that court.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>Restrictions</h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
          between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
          (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b)
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
          class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c)
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
          purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or
          any other persons.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
          above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration:
          (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
          validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b)
          any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
          invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for
          injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or
          unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
          falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
          unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of
          competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
          above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
          that court.
